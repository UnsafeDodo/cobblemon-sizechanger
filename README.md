# Cobblemon Size-Changer

A sidemod for the Cobblemon mod to change a pokémon's size.
This is a server side mod, so must be installed on server, not client.
<br><br>
## Installation
Put the .jar file in the "mods" folder
**Requires Cobblemon and Fabric API**

<br><br>
## Commands
There is only one command: `/pokesize <player><partyslot><scale>`

Example: scaling my first pokémon in the team by 2.5 will be `/pokesize UnsafeDodo 1 2.5`

<br><br>
## Permissions
By default the command can be run by admins only.
This mod supports LuckPerms, and the permission to use it is `pokesize.set`
